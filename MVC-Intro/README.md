Create a simple sqlite db using the movie-metadata.csv with one table and the following fields:

- Movie
- Rating (Add a column with randomized ratings from 1.0 - 5.0)
- Genre(Choose first genre from the column)

Then create a MVC based program which allows a user to explore the db so he/she can choose a movie to watch.The following functionality should be present:

- User to be able to view the movies sorted just by ratings
- View movies only over a certain rating
- View movies sorted by Genre
- View movies sorted by Rating and Genre
- Check if a certain movie title is present
